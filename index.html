            <h4>What is Body Language?</h4>
            <main id="lead">
                <div id="lead-one">
                    <p>Body language is a form of nonverbal communication that involves the gestures, movements, and
                        postures of
                        a person. It plays a crucial role in how individuals express their emotions, attitudes, and
                        intentions.
                        Body language is used to convey messages and can often reveal more about a person's thoughts and
                        feelings than verbal communication alone.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="lead-two">
                    <h3>Facial expressions</h3>
                    <p>One of the key components of body language is facial expressions. The face is capable of
                        displaying a
                        wide range of emotions, such as happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, and disgust. Smiling,
                        frowning,
                        raised eyebrows, and narrowed eyes are all examples of facial expressions that can convey
                        different
                        emotions. A smile, for instance, is often associated with happiness and friendliness, while a
                        frown can
                        signal displeasure or anger.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="lead-th">
                    <h3>Gestures</h3>
                    <p>Another important aspect of body language is gestures. Gestures involve the movements of the
                        hands,
                        arms, and other parts of the body to communicate a message. For example, waving goodbye,
                        pointing,
                        nodding, and shaking one's head are all common gestures that convey different meanings. In
                        some
                        cultures, certain gestures may have specific meanings or be considered offensive, so it is
                        important to
                        be aware of cultural differences when interpreting body language.</p>

                    <figcaption>Despite his calm expression, his hand signals and gestures suggest he is blocking information or feeling negative about the situation.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <div id="lead-fr">
                    <h3>Posture</h3>
                    <p>Posture is also a significant component of body language. The way a person stands, sits, and
                        carries
                        themselves can reveal a lot about their confidence, mood, and attitude. For example, someone who
                        is
                        standing up straight with their shoulders back and head held high may appear confident and
                        assertive,
                        while someone who is slouched over and avoiding eye contact may seem insecure or disinterested.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="lead-fv">
                    <h3>Eye Contact</h3>
                    <p>Eye contact is another important aspect of body language. The eyes can convey a wealth of
                        information,
                        from sincerity and trustworthiness to deceit and discomfort. Maintaining eye contact during
                        a conversation can signal interest and attentiveness, while avoiding or breaking eye contact
                        can signal discomfort or disinterest. In some cultures, prolonged eye contact is considered
                        rude or aggressive, while in others it is a sign of respect or attentiveness.</p>
