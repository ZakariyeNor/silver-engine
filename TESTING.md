# Testing

- The all features on the website are tested and they working as it expected. 

## Mobile devices 

- mobile devices has hamburger icon on the top right and when you click there, there will be home, about, ufe and 
sign-up page. it has box-shadow and back.g-color. The user can navigate from page to page just clicking. and it 
works as it's expacted.

### Ipads up to larger labtops and desktops

- Navigation bar is on the top right side on the page and the user can navigate them just clicking and it works as expected.

### The website to all devices testing

- The footer has contact informations and social media links. 
- The contact informations is not links they just give the user the information, if the user click on the phone icone or email it won't work and that is what it expacted.
But the social media links works they are linked in footer and when the user click on of them it opens in a new tab. 
- The social media links are not the reallinks they are prettende links they taking the user to the main websites 
depends which one the user clicked.

##### The footer and header are consistent in every page to all devices. And it works as expacted. 

### During testing assets/Text.info

##### Second testing 
- Css No error was found except the font-family import.
- index.html: errors (more h1 elements)
- about.html: errors ( more h1 elements, one more icons closing tag and the main section did'nt had article closing tag and the footer had main element instead of div)
- sign.up: errors (main element in the footer, more h1 elements, no article closing tag)
- ufe: errors (more h1 elements)
- I fixed the errors and there was one warning I got help with the Tutor assistant. I had h1 in anchor and the validator gave me warning that I shall use the h1 as a top level element. I fixed this to change the h1 element to h2 and give class and so the style takes the class name.
